# league_of_legends_randomizer
Date: October 2019 - January 2020

This is a small program I made to completely choose champions, items and runes randomly. 
This program is only updated up to Sett, so champions after that and items are not included in this.

I used this to do some fun challenges with my friends and is a very simple program.

My goal of coding this is:
  1. experiment and work with enums
  2. practice Java Swing
  
What does this program do:
  1. choose a random champion, five items, one boot, primary rune and secondary runes.
    - I also added some of the item restrictions such as:
         - two items that you cannot buy together
         - champions that you cannot buy on a champion
         - champions that cannot buy boots
  2. when run, a window appears to display your results.
  
How it can be improved:
  1. refresh button to get a different randomize
  2. add rune shard randomization
    - I could not find the sprites for it, but coded it in
  3. make window look nicer
  4. update it
